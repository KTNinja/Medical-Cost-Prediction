# Medical-Cost-Prediction
This project is about an ML program to calculate the medical cost of a patient base on various factors like Age, Sex, BMI, No of children, whether the person smokes and his region.
Since the data is of less no of patients i.e about 1300 so, it is not very accurate but gives us a rough idea of how we can use the data in this case.
